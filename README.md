Honors project for the [Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/agile-development-and-scrum) course by IBM Skills Network


This repository demonstrates Agile practices through the development of a back-end product catalog for an e-commerce website. It involves creating a product backlog, refining user stories, planning and executing a sprint, and simulating an Agile workflow using a Kanban board.

In this project, you will act as:

Product Owner: Define and organize user stories.
Scrum Master: Facilitate sprint planning and oversee sprint execution.
Developer: Complete user stories by moving them across the Kanban board.
Features and Stakeholder Requirements
The stakeholders have requested the following features:

Create a product in the catalog.
Retrieve a product from the catalog.
Update a product in the catalog.
Delete a product from the catalog.
Like a product in the catalog.
Dislike a product in the catalog.
List all products in the catalog.
Query a subset of products in the catalog.
Host the solution in the cloud.
Automate deployments to the cloud.

Repository Setup
Kanban Board: A Kanban board is used to manage the backlog, sprint planning, and sprint execution.
Access it under the Projects tab.

User Stories: User stories have been created as issues, with acceptance criteria defined using the Gherkin syntax.
Example:

Copy code
Given [context],  
When [action],  
Then [outcome].
Labels: Each issue has been labeled as either enhancement or technical debt.
